# Supervised Learning Demos: Life Sciences Applications

Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating supervised learning concepts through real-world life sciences problems.

## ðŸ“š Available Demos

### 1. ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification (`supervised_learning_demo.ipynb`)
Botanical species identification using flower measurements

### 2. ðŸ’Š Drug Discovery & Molecular Classification (`drug_discovery_demo.ipynb`)

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

**The Challenge**: A botanist has collected measurements of iris flowers but needs an automated way to identify the species. Manual classification is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially when dealing with hundreds of samples.

**What We're Solving**: Build an intelligent system that can automatically classify iris flowers into their correct species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on four physical measurements:
- Sepal length and width  
- Petal length and width

**Real-World Impact**: This type of classification system is used in:
- Botanical research and species identification
- Agricultural quality control  
- Biodiversity monitoring
- Educational tools for biology students

## ðŸŽ¯ Demo Objectives

By completing this notebook, you will:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Learn how to frame a real-world classification challenge
2. **Master Data Preparation**: Explore, visualize, and prepare data for machine learning
3. **Apply Supervised Learning**: Train models to learn from labeled examples
4. **Compare Algorithms**: Understand when to use Logistic Regression vs Random Forest
5. **Evaluate Performance**: Measure and interpret model accuracy and reliability
6. **Make Predictions**: Use trained models to classify new, unseen flowers
7. **Visualize Decision Boundaries**: See how models separate different classes
8. **Interpret Results**: Understand feature importance and model insights

## ðŸ¤” Why Supervised Learning?

**Supervised learning is perfect for this problem because**:

âœ… **We have labeled data**: Each flower sample comes with its known species (the "ground truth")

âœ… **Clear input-output relationship**: Physical measurements (input) â†’ Species classification (output)

âœ… **Pattern recognition task**: We want the model to learn the relationship between measurements and species

âœ… **Predictive goal**: Once trained, we want to classify new flowers we haven't seen before

## ðŸŒ³ Why Random Forest Classifier?

**Random Forest is excellent for this classification task because**:

ðŸŽ¯ **Handles multiple features well**: Can effectively use all 4 measurements simultaneously

ðŸŽ¯ **Robust to outliers**: Won't be thrown off by unusual flower measurements

ðŸŽ¯ **Feature importance**: Tells us which measurements are most important for classification

ðŸŽ¯ **Non-linear relationships**: Can capture complex patterns between measurements and species

ðŸŽ¯ **Confidence scores**: Provides probability estimates for predictions

ðŸŽ¯ **Interpretable**: We can understand how decisions are made

**Comparison with Logistic Regression**:
- **Logistic Regression**: Simple, fast, assumes linear relationships
- **Random Forest**: More complex, handles non-linear patterns, ensemble method for better accuracy
