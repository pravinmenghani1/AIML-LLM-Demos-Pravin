## üß† Key Learning Outcomes

After completing this demo, you'll understand:

- How neural networks make predictions (forward pass)
- How neural networks learn from mistakes (backward pass)
- The role of activation functions and loss functions
- How gradient descent optimizes network weights
- How to evaluate and interpret model performance
- What features neural networks learn to detect

## üîß Customization Options

The notebook is designed to be easily modified:

- **Architecture**: Change layer sizes in the `DeepNeuralNetwork` class
- **Hyperparameters**: Adjust learning rate, batch size, and epochs
- **Dataset Size**: Modify the data loading section to use more/fewer samples
- **Visualizations**: Add your own plots and analysis

## üìä Expected Results

With the default settings, you should achieve:
- Training accuracy: ~95-98%
- Test accuracy: ~92-95%
- Clear learning curves showing decreasing loss
- Interpretable weight visualizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Slow training**: Reduce dataset size or increase batch size
2. **Poor convergence**: Try different learning rates (0.001, 0.01, 0.1)
3. **Memory issues**: Reduce batch size or use fewer samples
4. **Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

## üìà Next Steps

After mastering this demo, consider:

1. **Advanced Architectures**: Implement CNNs or RNNs
2. **Regularization**: Add dropout or L2 regularization
3. **Optimization**: Implement Adam or RMSprop optimizers
4. **Real Applications**: Apply to your own datasets
5. **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Transition to TensorFlow or PyTorch
