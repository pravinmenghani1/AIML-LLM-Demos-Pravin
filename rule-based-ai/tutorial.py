Rule-Based AI (also called Expert Systems) was the dominant AI approach from 1950-1980s.
Famous systems: MYCIN (medical diagnosis), DENDRAL (chemistry), XCON (computer configuration)

Key Concept: Human expertise is captured as IF-THEN rules
Example: "IF patient has fever AND cough THEN suspect respiratory infection"

RULE-BASED AI (1950s-1980s):

‚ùå Hard to handle uncertainty
‚ùå Requires manual knowledge encoding

MODERN AI (Neural Networks, LLMs):
‚úÖ Learns from data automatically
‚úÖ Handles uncertainty and ambiguity
‚úÖ Works on complex, unstructured problems
