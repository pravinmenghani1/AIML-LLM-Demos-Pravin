# ðŸ¤– Transformer Architecture Demo

An interactive, visually appealing demonstration of how transformer neural networks process and generate text.

## Features

- **Real-time Attention Visualization**: See how attention weights connect different tokens
- **Layer-by-layer Processing**: Watch tokens flow through transformer layers
- **Interactive Text Generation**: Generate new tokens and see the process
- **Animated UI**: Smooth animations and visual effects
- **Educational**: Perfect for understanding transformer architecture

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Enter text in the input field
3. Click "Process Text" to see how transformers work
4. Click "Generate Next" to add new tokens

## What You'll See

- **Attention Matrix**: Shows how each token "pays attention" to other tokens
- **Token Flow**: Visualizes how tokens move through transformer layers
- **Multi-head Attention**: See all 8 attention heads working in parallel
- **Real-time Processing**: Watch the transformer work step by step

## Educational Value

This demo helps visualize:
- How attention mechanisms work
- Multi-layer processing in transformers
- Token-based text processing
- Parallel attention heads
- The flow of information through the network

Perfect for students, developers, and anyone curious about how modern AI language models work!
