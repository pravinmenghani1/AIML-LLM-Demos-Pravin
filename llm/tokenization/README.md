# Tokenization in LLMs Demo

A comprehensive demonstration of how tokenization works in Large Language Models, with practical examples and comparisons.

## Problem Statement

Understanding tokenization is crucial for:
- **Cost Optimization**: Token count directly affects API costs
- **Prompt Engineering**: Better prompts require understanding token boundaries
- **Model Behavior**: Tokenization affects how models interpret text
- **Performance**: Efficient tokenization improves processing speed

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook tokenization_demo.ipynb
   ```

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Tokenization Fundamentals
- What are tokens and why they matter
- Different tokenization approaches
- Trade-offs between methods

### 2. Practical Implementation
- Simple BPE implementation from scratch
- Real-world tokenizers (GPT-4, BERT, GPT-2)
- Comparative analysis

### 3. Cost and Performance Impact
- Token counting for API cost estimation
- Prompt optimization techniques
- Best practices for efficiency

### 4. Hands-on Examples
- Interactive token counter
- Visualization of tokenization differences
- Special tokens and edge cases

## Key Takeaways

- **GPT-4 typically uses fewer tokens** than BERT for the same text
- **Subword tokenization** (BPE) balances vocabulary size and sequence length
- **Token optimization** can reduce API costs by 20-50%
- **Different models tokenize differently** - always check your specific model

## Files Included

- `tokenization_demo.ipynb` - Main demonstration notebook
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Start

Run this to see tokenization in action:

```python
import tiktoken

# Load GPT-4 tokenizer
tokenizer = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")

# Tokenize text
text = "Hello, world! This is tokenization."
tokens = tokenizer.encode(text)
decoded = [tokenizer.decode([token]) for token in tokens]

print(f"Text: {text}")
print(f"Tokens: {decoded}")
print(f"Token count: {len(tokens)}")
```

## Next Steps

1. Run through the complete notebook
2. Try your own text examples
3. Experiment with different models
4. Implement token counting in your projects
